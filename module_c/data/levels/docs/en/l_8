Archimede didn't really know for how long time she was walking. The labyrinth
looked like a huge non-ending corridor. But as she was taking the next turning,
she suddenly was facing a... door ? No way to go back, nor to borrow
another lane. She definitely has to open it.

Here is the function to use when you are facing a door :

	open_door (direction);

Good luck !
