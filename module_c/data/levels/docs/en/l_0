	Here are the commands youâ€™ll need throughout the game :


help			This command will give you all the commands you need to play the game.
			So, if there's any of the following command you forgot, juste type help
			in the terminal.

setlanguage		This one will change the language of the game into the language you
			want.

howtoplay		This command will show you specific instructions about the current
			level. You should read the howtoplay for each one (like, really, no joke).
			It may provide you some REALLY nice informations to complete it.

editcode		This command will open the file where to write your instructions.

playgame		This one will... launch the game. Surprising, huh ? Of course,
			you may launch it once before typing the code, so you can see
			what the level looks like.

nextlevel		If Archimede got to the exit, you may type this command to go
			to the next level.

resetlevel		This command should be useful, in case you messed up something in
			the code and that's not working anymore, or if you wanna retry the level.

restartgame		Careful with this one. This will erase all your progression, and
			you will restart from the first level.




	Pretty easy, isn't it ?
