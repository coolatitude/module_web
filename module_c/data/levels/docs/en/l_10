Well, well, well...
This next level should remind you something. It's a good opportunity to
learn something new !

In C language, there are many tools you can use to simplify your coder life.
This includes what we call LOOPS.

A loop is a piece of code that will be executed as long as a condition verified.
A condition can be, for instance :

	variable == 1	-> Is the variable equal to 1 ?
	variable > 19	-> Is the variable greater than 19 ?
	variable < 42	-> Is the variable smaller than 42 ?
	variable >= 101	-> Is the variable greater than or equal to 101 ?
	variable <= 0	-> Is the variable smaller than or equal to 0 ?

Of course, this variable can be modified during the loop. And it actually will
often be the case, with INCREMENTED VARIABLES. You will have a proper example
in the code.
