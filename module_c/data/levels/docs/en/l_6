Do you have a good memory ?
Archimede does. (Of course ! It is Archimede.)

You can ask her to remember things by using VARIABLES.
Variables are kind of containers that will contain an information (a number,
a character, binary data, and so on...).

First, you need to tell her the name of your variable. This is called
VARIABLE DECLARATION, and you can to it this way :

	int my_awesome_var;

A variable name should always start with a letter, and should only contain
lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_).

You have then to give it a value. This is the funniest part.

	my_awesome_var = 19;

And BIM, my_awesome_var now contains the best number of the world !
You can also use variables into functions, just like this :

	cool_function (my_awesome_var);

You will see a very practical example in the code of this level.
