Hm, this one may be a bit more tricky. You have only 40 lines to achieve the
goal, so you better use loops, loops everywhere !

Also, you can use loops inside other loops. But then, you have to use different
incremented variables for the conditions (obviously). Maybe the code that is
already written could help you understand it a bit more...
