You should be comfortable with the walk (direction) function now, right ?
Ok so, let's add some more challenge.

As you know, there are two mode in VIM. The "normal mode", where you can type
commands to interact with VIM, and the INSERT mode, where you can type text.

When you are in the normal mode, you can type several commands
and perform some useful actions on your text. Here are some that may
particularly fit your needs for this adventure :

:x		You already used it. You can use it to save and quit VIM.

dd		This command will delete the line you cursor is on.

10dd	This one will delete the 10 first line, starting for the line the cursor
		is on. Obviously, you can turn the "10" in any number you want, according
		to the amount of lines you wanna delete.

u			This is the UNDO command. Very useful •ᴗ•


This level is the first one in which the amount of line in the file is limited.
For each level, you can know if it is limited on the top of the howtoplay. For
this one, you are limited to 10. If you have too many lines, the game won't even
launch. In this case, you should then look your code, just to see if there
aren't any useless lines ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Press Q to quit.
