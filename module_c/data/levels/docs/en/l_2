Well done, you got out of the first room !
Hmmm... The next one should be easy then, right ?

Just in case, here's the walk function's prototype again :

	walk (direction)

... with direction = UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. You can type "help" in the
terminal whenever you want in the future if you forgot it.

Oh and don't forget : to write in VIM editor, you have to turn it into
INSERT mode (press I on the keyboard). To save the file and leave the
editor, you need to be out of the edit mode (press ESC on your keyboard),
and you have to type :x on your keyboard.





Press Q to quit.
