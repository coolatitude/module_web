Oh, damn ! It looks like Archimede the owl is stuck into a labyrinth.
She definitly needs your help to get out of it !
              
Would you please tell her what she needs to do ? This is pretty easy, just write her
simple instructions so she can follow them step by step.
              
 
 
By the way, she only understands the C language. Oh, you don't know it ?
Well... you better be a fast learner !
              
 
 
 
For each level of this game, you will have to follow a few steps :
 
	- Look at the level's map
	- Type the instructions in the instructions file
	- Test it
	- Type the instructions again (would't be fun if it was a one shot, right ?)
	- Retest it
	- ...
	- Did Archimede finally found a way out ? Great, then go to the next level.
 
To achieve this, you will need a few commands to type in the terminal (you know,
this ugly black window think where you can type text in). The first you're gonna
learn is :
 
	howtoplay
 
Try it out ! First, leave this intro screen by pressing Q on your keyboard. Then,
type howtoplay and press enter.
