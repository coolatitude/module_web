**	The for loop does exactly the same thing than the while loop, but
**	its syntax is slightly different. It allows you to declare your iterator
**	write your condition and increment your iterator on the same line.
**
**	It is written like this :
**	for (int iterator = 1 ; condition ; iterator++)
**	{
**		code to execute
**	}
**
**	Note : iterator++ is a shorter way to write
**		iterator = iterator + 1
**	This is called and incrementation operator.
