/*
**	Welcome in your first C code file !
**
**	What you see just right down there is called a function. A function
**	is basically a piece of code that will be executed by the program.
**
**	You'll need to write the instructions for Archimede between those {
**	and } brackets, and of course, you should not delete these brackets, or
**	the game will give you an error.
**
**	There is already an instruction written. Here it is :
**
**		walk(direction)
**
**	It will tell Archimede to walk one step in the direction you choose. Simply
**	replace "direction" by the direction you want in CAPITAL LETTERS
**	=> LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN
**
**	One last thing : every C instruction must be followed by a semi-collon
**	(;) in order to be valid.
**
**	For now, leave this file and type "playgame" in the terminal. You will have
**	a preview of the map.
**	Then, come back here by typing "editcode" to add instructions in order to
**	complete the level.
**
**	Good luck !
