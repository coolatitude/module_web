<text>First, the basics!
<text>"HTML is the background."
<text>In HTML, we use tags to structure a page. These tags form blocks and indicate what these blocks are or do.

Tags always go in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
For example <div> opens a block and </div> closes it.

There are 3 pairs of fundamental tags:
	<html></html> : we always start with the tag <html> which announces that the rest will be html code, and we close everything at the end with </html>.
	<head></head> contains metadata, i. e. data that will not be readable on the web page, but is important for the web browser.
	<body></body> contains everything that will be visible on the web page.

Then the most common is the <div></div> tag, which simply allows you to structure the page. Like when you structure a text by creating paragraphs.
Then, the tag <a href="url of a web page"></a> allows to insert a link to another web page.
Finally, the tag <img src="image.jpg">, as its name indicates, allows you to insert an image.

There are many other tags.
You can try for example <h1></h1> or <p></p> or even <strong></strong>
You will discover them little by little...
<text>Let's try!
<text>Observe the code and the result carefully.
<text>Then, try for example :
	to add the HTML tags
	to modify the link
	to change the title tag "h3" to "h1".
	to add a paragraph
	to change the page to which the link refers
	add a button ('button' tag)
<text>With each change you make in the code, you will need to click on the'refresh' arrow to see the result
<text>Be careful, if you refresh the page, all your changes in the code will disappear.
<text><head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div>
			<h3>Archim√®de, this hero</h3>
			<p>Archimedes is the true spiritual master of Merlin. Without him, Merlin would be nothing.</p>
			<p>He occasionally tries to educate Mosquitoes. But this kid doesn't understand anything about anything.</p>
			<p>Humans are <strong>infuriating</strong>.</p>

			<div contentEditable="true">

			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
<text>Result
<text>Simple, isn't it?
