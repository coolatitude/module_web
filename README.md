Hi,

Welcome on the nineteen coding school's web module.

to start the server just run "python launch.py"

the editor page: localhost:8000/editor.html

the home page : localhost:8000/

the dev logic:
- the python give the main JS to the browser at first launch.
- this js will generate the menu and manage the languages.
- then this js will load the html, wich has no text, of the current page.
- it'll fill the html with the parsed text from lang/$Locale$/
