I am Archimedes
I will be your guide in the world of the Web
It starts here....

First, the basics!
"HTML is the background."
Let's try it!

Observe the code and the result carefully.

Then, try for example:
to modify the title
to change the title tag "h3" to "h1".
to add a sentence
to change the page to which the link refers
add a button ('button' tag)

With each change you make in the code, you will need to click on the'refresh' arrow to see the result

Be careful, if you refresh the page, all your changes in the code will disappear.

Archimedes, this hero

Archimedes is the true spiritual master of Merlin. Without him, Merlin would be nothing.

He occasionally tries to educate Mosquitoes. But this kid doesn't understand anything about anything.

Humans are infuriating.

Even if they are sometimes hilarious....
Simple, isn't it?

First, the basics!

Harder, better, stronger!
Well, it's time now to get out of google chrome, and create/edit your HTML and CSS files directly...



Open the small_bain_web folder on the desktop of your workstation.
You will find the files 19.html and 19.css, and some more images.

Open these files 19.html and 19.css with Sublim Text, by dragging the small_bain_web folder over this icon in applications.
(Sublim Text is a text editor, like Word or Open Office, but specifically for code. There are others, but why not him?)


You can now write html code in 19.html, where indicated, and css in 19.css
To make it easier for you if you want to include images, we have already provided some of them.


To view your work, it's easy: double-click on 19.html, the file will open in a web browser.
Each time you modify any of the 19.html or 19.css files, you only need to refresh the page in the browser.


A tip: on your web page in the browser: right click, then "Inspect
The browser console will open.
And you can see all your code and modify it!
You will see the changes live on your page, which is very convenient for working.
But be careful, these changes are temporary and will disappear at the next page refresh.
Don't forget to copy and paste these temporary changes into your 19.html and 19.css files to save them.




You have carte blanche, be creative, enjoy yourself!
